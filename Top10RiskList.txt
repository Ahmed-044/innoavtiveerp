Keeping track of the top 10 risks throughout our sprints

Sprint 2:
1. 
    PROBLEM: Not completing Sales and Vendor modules early enough to leave time to create ledger, accounts receivable and accounts payable 
    SOL: Communicate better amongst a team and try to get the work done earlier.

2.  PROBLEM: Miscommunication with product owner on what is expected from the  
    SOL: Ask numerous different questions to Fatima in order to build a clear image.

3.  PROBLEM: CSS from certain components could cause issues in other components.
    SOL: Determine which component is causing the problem and fix it.

4.  PROBLEM: Miscommunication amongst teams and not having the expected result we needed to work cohesively.
    SOL: Communicate extensively with teammates

5.  PROBLEM: Scheduling conflicts with respect to other courses. Difficult to meet with teams and keep an open dialogue.
    SOL: Create team meetings at the beginning of each sprint and set dates in advance.
    
6.  PROBLEM: Potential issues with respect to bad time estimation. 
    SOL: Re-evaluate user story point assignment for issues.

7.  PROBLEM: Slow request-response times with respect to communication between client (React) and server (Phoenix).
    SOL: Determine which component is causing the bottleneck and eliminate any inefficiencies.

8.  PROBLEM: Getting up to speed on Elixir while respecting project time constraints.
    SOL: Time management and extreme programming.

9.  PROBLEM: Insufficient planning with respect to testing for the front-end. 
    SOL: Find a React testing framework and begin unit testing.

10. PROBLEM: Late completion of the work means a possible problem with creating elaborate tests for the software.
    SOL: Finish early!

    



Sprint 1:
1. 
    PROBLEM: Poor understanding of high-level project requirements. 
    SOL: Further discuss requirements with Product Owner, such as how clients will purchase products (bikes).

2.  PROBLEM: Using potentially outdated architecture client-side (class components vs functional). 
    SOL: Identify best practices using React documentation, and identify the optimal solution based on selected UI Framework.

3.  PROBLEM: Slow request-response times with respect to communication between client (React) and server (Phoenix).
    SOL: Determine which component is causing the bottleneck and eliminate any inefficiencies.

4.  PROBLEM: Issues with authentication feature.
    SOL: Need to identify if the issue is a result of improper form validation or if it is server-side.

5.  PROBLEM: Scheduling conflicts with respect to other courses. Difficult to meet with teams and keep an open dialogue.
    SOL: Create team meetings at the beginning of each sprint and set dates in advance.

6.  PROBLEM: Getting up to speed on Elixir while respecting project time constraints.
    SOL: Time management and extreme programming.
    
7.  PROBLEM: Potential issues with respect to bad time estimation. 
    SOL: Re-evaluate user story point assignment for issues.

8.  PROBLEM: Creating multiple prototypes as per project requirements. More difficult than anticipated (scope creep).
    SOL: Create prototypes that will be relevant to the project moving forward (can recycle work).

9.  PROBLEM: Insufficient planning with respect to testing for the front-end. 
    SOL: Find a React testing framework and begin unit testing.

10. PROBLEM: Project architecture and testing document deadlines approaching.
    SOL: Finish them!
